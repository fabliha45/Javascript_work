# Reflection 

I am motivated to work on these projects with the particular topic "Deforestation" and "Human Vs Nature" because of the current world situation. Very recently in the start of January 2020, the world has experienced a major bushfire in Australia. Australia takes up a huge part of the world if taken a look at the Global map. The bushfire did not only last for days and weeks but has also taken about many innocent lives. Fires have raged near the Australian capital Canberra for weeks. The island has always been renowned for its unique mix of animal species. There have been plenty news and report about the lives that have been affected by the fire. There are fears that the natural habitat of this area may never recover from this devastating fire crisis. Researchers have long warned that the rapid change of our planet while being hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more often with violent and more intense comeback. Droughts are a common scenario in Australia’s many parts for the last few years which makes fires like these to spread out quickly and uncontrollably. 

There are huge parts of wildfires in the western part of the United States as well. Questionably, out of the six most deadly wildfires from the year 1932 to this date, 2020 alone had five major wildfires in California. The largest among that has been experience on August 2020. The same year when we lost a huge habitat on Australia’s fire incident. For days, this fire in California has caused the air in San Francisco and some parts of Washington Seattle almost unbreathable due to extreme air pollution. After all this information shared about wildfires and bushfires, the question arise, why is the climate changing like this? Is there something that can be done to make it any better? 

My Exploratory Visualization project is about deforestation. Deforestation is one of the major causes of drought, habitat loss, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, water cycle disruption and most importantly over all climate change. Deforestation is the decrease in forestland across the world that are lost for different uses, for example, rural croplands, urbanization, mining exercises and on occasion for natural causes. Due to the rapid development of our industry, lifestyles and human activities, there has been a negative effect on our ecosystem with high deforestation rate. In the recent studies by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, it is seen that annually around 1.3 million km square per decade or area is under deforestation. The surge in greenhouse gases is one of the most essential cause of Global Warming. 

This brings me to my next project of Narrative Visualization, Human Vs Nature. The reason I named my project this, because the study done in my project ended up with the result that the major cause of global warming for the last 150 years and more is the emission of Greenhouse Gases into our nature. How is this gas produced? And why is it increasing rapidly every year? There are various activities of human on this planet that is causing this gas to increase daily. Starting from the use of electricity, transportation, agriculture and some of residential use and commercial use. The higher amount of heat absorb on the earth increases overall higher global temperature. There are some natural ways that causes greenhouse gases as well like carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and some nitrous oxide. These can easily be used up for many activities. Most importantly if there are more trees there would be less carbondioxide on the atmosphere. Hence cutting down trees directly affects our planet. The highlight of my project is to spread awareness that its on us, human beings, to help make the planet, our home, better. We can take initiatives and do our part to make a change. It might seem like one person cannot do much, but trust me, each drop of water makes up the sea. SO, every small step taking towards this will make a change. There are several organizations that works to make it better. We can use fewer plastic products and use more recycled things. As much as possible we can reduce the use of electricity and built solar panels to use even if little of it to make things happen. Most importantly we can plant trees for a better future. 
Both the projects are designed using the materials learn in the course Data73200 Interactive Data Visualization. I have little to no experience in HTML, java or css. This course helped me learn and apply my knowledge into the Tutorials as well as the project. I am really thankful to our course instructor for being so patience with us throughout the semester and guiding us all in making such informative and interesting projects. All the sessions with ideas and advises made the work much easier specially the feedbacks from both the instructor and peer members of the class. I have tried to apply as many visualization topics as possible to make the work more understandable. I would be really glad if this project can make one person take an initiative to help prevent Global Warming even a little. Remember every action counts!
