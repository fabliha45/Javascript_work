# Final_Portfolio_Fabliha Afia 
## Data_73200 Interactive Data Visualization_SP21


This is the Final Portfolio for the course DATA_73200.
Here you will be able to access to the two final projects, (i) Exploratory Visualization and (ii) Narative Visualization. For each project, there are drafts, sketch, data, code files and suitable links that direct you to each project

## Exploratory Visualization
Both my projects have a similar background. My main goal was to study Global Warming. In order to do that, I have chosen to major things that leads to Global Warming. For my Exploratory project, I chose the topic Deforestation. Here I will explain the major factors affecting it. There will be a column chart, a bar chart and two donut charts that would show necessary data explanation to understand reasons of deforestation. 

## Narrative Visualization 
Like I mentioned earlier, my projects somehow links to one another. For this project I chose the causes of Global Warming. Here there are factors shown that has an impact on our planet. For instant, all-natural causes and manmade causes. There will be a brief writing on each topic for a better understanding. Below I will link my project.
